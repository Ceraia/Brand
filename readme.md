## Philosophy
As this is a creative project by Axodouble, most philosophical points come from Axodoubles personal beliefs.

### Redistribution
We believe that the redistribution of software is essential, and that open-source software is key to a better future.
Open-Source software allows users of the community to aid in the development, build-upon or improve the software.

### Pay to Win
It is important we share our software, however open-source does not need to mean free.
It is impossible to expect to do everything for free, so this does not forbid us from in the future building donation-ware.
However we also strongly believe that users who are disadvantaged in their financial status should be able to acquire the same, or similar experience as those of users who pay or donate to the project.
This means that anything that lets users donate or pay for a reward or service should not give any unfair benefit to the players experience.

This however opens another problem, certain services or pieces of software unfortunately cannot be provided for free, so as an alternative we want to make it so that users who are disadvantaged in their financial status should be able to build the same experience, service or software from scratch using their own services to either cut-down or even eliminate all the costs.

### Early Release Software
Some software may be purchaseable when it is in early release.
This is to aid or sponsor the development costs, aswell as offer better support when a program or application is in development.
